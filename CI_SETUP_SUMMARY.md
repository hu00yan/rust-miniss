# CI Matrix & Build Validation Setup Summary

This document summarizes the CI configuration and feature gate validation setup for the rust-miniss project.

## Implemented CI Matrix

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

The CI pipeline validates the following backend combinations:

1. **Linux + io-uring backend**
   - Runner: `ubuntu-latest`
   - Features: `io-uring`
   - Target: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - Note: Includes TODO for potential Orbstack self-hosted runner optimization

2. **Linux + epoll backend**
   - Runner: `ubuntu-latest`
   - Features: `epoll`
   - Target: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

3. **macOS + kqueue backend**
   - Runner: `macos-latest`
   - Features: `kqueue`
   - Target: `x86_64-apple-darwin`

### Validation Steps

Each backend combination runs:
- ✅ Code formatting check (`cargo fmt --check`)
- ✅ Clippy linting with backend-specific features
- ✅ Build with specific backend features
- ✅ Build with all features
- ✅ Tests with specific backend features
- ✅ Tests with all features
- ✅ Benchmark compilation (`cargo bench --no-run`)

### Additional CI Jobs

1. **Feature Combinations Test**
   - Validates all possible feature flag combinations
   - Tests feature interaction compatibility
   - Ensures no compilation conflicts

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Runs criterion benchmarks for each backend
   - Captures benchmark results as CI artifacts
   - Validates performance regression detection

3. **Cross-compilation Check**
   - Tests compilation for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - Tests compilation for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - Tests compilation for `x86_64-apple-darwin`

## Feature Gates Configuration

### Cargo.toml Features
```toml
[features]
default = []
multicore = []
epoll = []
kqueue = []
io-uring = []
```

### Platform-specific Dependencies
- `io-uring = "0.7"` - Linux only (conditional compilation)
- Backend modules conditionally compiled based on feature flags

## Benchmark Infrastructure

### Runtime Benchmarks (`benches/runtime_benchmarks.rs`)
- Runtime creation benchmark
- Basic task spawning benchmark
- Uses criterion framework for statistical analysis
- Configured with `harness = false` in Cargo.toml

## Validation Results

✅ **Successful Tests:**
- Basic compilation with no features
- Multicore feature compilation and testing
- Epoll backend compilation (Linux-compatible)
- Kqueue backend compilation (cross-platform compatible)
- Benchmark compilation and setup
- Feature combination validation

⚠️ **Known Issues:**
- io-uring backend implementation needs fixes (compilation errors)
- Some kqueue backend tests fail on certain macOS configurations
- Task cancellation tests are ignored pending fixes

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CI Matrix | ✅ Complete | Ready for GitHub Actions |
| Feature Gates | ✅ Complete | Proper conditional compilation |
| Benchmarks | ✅ Complete | Criterion integration working |
| Cross-compilation | ✅ Complete | Multi-architecture support |
| Backend Validation | ⚠️ Partial | epoll/kqueue work, io-uring needs fixes |

## Next Steps

1. Fix io-uring backend compilation issues
2. Resolve kqueue backend test failures on macOS
3. Consider adding self-hosted runners with Orbstack for optimal Linux io-uring testing
4. Enable ignored task cancellation tests once underlying issues are resolved

## Usage

To run CI validation locally:
```bash
# Test specific backend
cargo test --features epoll
cargo test --features kqueue
cargo test --features multicore

# Test all working features
cargo test --features "epoll,kqueue,multicore"

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench --no-run
cargo bench --features multicore --no-run

# Check compilation with all features
cargo check --all-features
```

The CI pipeline will automatically run on pushes and pull requests to `main` and `develop` branches.
