# Phase 1.2 Task Checklist

This file tracks the compilation errors and audit findings that need to be addressed.

## Compilation Errors

- [x] **`src/cpu.rs`**: `set_cpu_affinity` called on non-Linux platforms. ✅ RESOLVED - Platform-specific compilation
- [x] **`src/multicore.rs`**: `cannot move out of type MultiCoreRuntime` which implements the `Drop` trait. ✅ RESOLVED - Fixed with shutdown_internal() method

## Warnings

- [x] **`src/task.rs`**: Unused import `crate::cpu::CrossCpuMessage`. ✅ RESOLVED - Import is used
- [x] **`src/cpu.rs`**: Unused import `unbounded`. ✅ RESOLVED - Using bounded channels
- [x] **`src/multicore.rs`**: Unused mutable variable `handles`. ✅ RESOLVED - Variables are used

## Audit Findings

- [x] **Issue #1**: Implement `Drop` for `MultiCoreRuntime` for graceful shutdown. ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Issue #3**: Use bounded channels for back-pressure control. ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] **Issue #5**: Improve panic handling in multicore `block_on`.
- [x] **Issue #6**: Use a global atomic counter for robust task ID generation. ✅ COMPLETED
